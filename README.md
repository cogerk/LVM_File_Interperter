# LVM_File_Interperter
This is a small project intended to create measurement files created from LabVIEW and parse them into a CSV time series.
#run1.txt
This is the labview file.  It was orginally a .lvm file and was then resaved as a .txt file.

#interperter.py
This script looks for timestamps and amperage measurements and matches them in a dataframe.  That dataframe is then written to run1.csv.

#run1.csv
This is the final output of the file.
